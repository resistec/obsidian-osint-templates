# Glossary
- **Aesthetics**: visions and concepts of beauty (and its discontents) in the product and their representations. Example: descriptions of the ugly.
- **Author**: the person or organization that generates the content of the product, defines its narrative structure, forms its story line and generates the intellectual part of the product that is later disseminated.
- **Content Analysis**: This type of narrative analysis involves examining the content of a narrative in order to identify themes, motifs, and other patterns. Researchers may use coding schemes to identify specific themes or categories within the text, and then analyze how they are related to each other and to the overall narrative. Content analysis can be used to study various forms of communication, including written texts, oral interviews, and visual media.
- **Content**: what is said. The themes, events, and characters in a story provide insights into the storyteller’s experiences, beliefs, and values. Therefore, narrative analysis sees content as inseparable from structure and performance. All three work together to create the meaning of a story.
- **Critical Analysis**: This type of narrative analysis involves examining the political, social, and ideological implications of a narrative, and questioning its underlying assumptions and values. Researchers may analyze the ways in which a narrative reflects or reinforces dominant power structures, or how it challenges or subverts those structures. Critical analysis can be useful for understanding the role that narratives play in shaping social and cultural norms.
- **Discourse Analysis**: This type of narrative analysis focuses on the language and discourse used in a narrative, including the social and cultural context in which it is situated. Researchers may analyze the use of specific words or phrases, the tone and style of the narrative, or the ways in which social and cultural norms are reflected in the narrative. Discourse analysis can be useful for understanding how narratives are influenced by larger social and cultural structures.
- **Interactional Analysis:** Interactional analysis looks at how narratives are created and understood within the context of social interactions. This approach acknowledges that narratives are not created in isolation but are shaped by the listener’s responses, the social context of the storytelling, and the relationship between the storyteller and the listener. E.g. Mishler’s Model.
- **Narrative**: a narrative is a story that has been shaped and given meaning by a storyteller.
- **Narrative Structure**: examining how elements like plot, setting, and characterisation are used to construct a story. For example, a researcher might study how the sequence of events, the choice of words, or the use of metaphors shapes the meaning of a story.
- **Performance Analysis**: Examining the performative elements of storytelling such as the use of language, nonverbal communication, and audience engagement provides further insights into how stories are constructed and the effects they create. Researchers are interested in how the narrator positions themselves in relation to the audience.
- - **Performance:** Narratives are not simply neutral accounts of events but are performed and co-constructed through interactions between the storyteller and the audience. Example: actors interact with or reference members of the audience with the intent to establish a certain kind of emotional attachment. 
- **Phenomenological Analysis**: This type of narrative analysis focuses on the subjective experience of the narrator, and how they interpret and make sense of their experiences. Researchers may analyze the language used to describe experiences, the emotions expressed in the narrative, or the ways in which the narrator constructs meaning from their experiences. Phenomenological analysis can be useful for understanding how people make sense of their own lives and experiences.
- **Product**: the intellectual property, or product, is the artefact that the author generates for an intended audience to consume.
- **Rhetorical Devices**: tools that enable the author to exert a desired effect on the audience. Example: shouting to assert one's authority through fear and intimidation.
- **Story line**: a story or story line is a structured account of events.
- **Structural Analysis:** This approach views language as a resource and an object for investigation, moving beyond the referential content. Structural analysis assumes the way a story is told is as important as the content of the story. Following Labov’s Narrative Model, the researcher may focus on identifying and examining the key elements of narrative structure, such as the abstract, orientation, complicating action, evaluation, resolution, and coda.
- **Structural Analysis**: This type of narrative analysis focuses on the formal structure of a narrative, including its plot, character development, and use of literary devices. Researchers may analyze the narrative arc, the relationship between the protagonist and antagonist, or the use of symbolism and metaphor. Structural analysis can be useful for understanding how a narrative is constructed and how it affects the reader or audience.
- **[Thematic Analysis](https://www.simplypsychology.org/thematic-analysis.html):** Thematic analysis assumes language is a direct and unambiguous route to meaning. In this approach, researchers collect many stories and then inductively create conceptual groupings from the data. One of the assumptions of thematic analysis is that everyone in the group means the same thing by what they say, even when grouped into a similar thematic category.
- **Thematic Analysis**: This method involves identifying themes or patterns that emerge from the data, and then interpreting these themes in relation to the research question. Researchers may use a deductive approach, where they start with a pre-existing theoretical framework, or an inductive approach, where themes are generated from the data itself.
