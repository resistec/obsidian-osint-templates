> **Remember**: a coinbase transaction's output can be spent only when it reaches a depth of 100+ blocks. This means if an asset was moved in Transaction A, when it is moved in Transaction B, the [height](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/blockchain/height/) [difference](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/mining/coinbase-transaction/#coinbase-maturity) between the blocks will be no less than 100.
